## âœ¨ Key Features

- Modular scripting language based on semantic blocks
- Direct interpretation by AI â€” no compilers or external parsers
- Supports external variables and range-based execution
- Applicable to academic, technical, and editorial production
- Multilingual and adaptable to any domain of knowledge

## ðŸ“¦ Repository Structure

- `/docs` â€” Technical documentation for the ISAAC language
- `/scripts` â€” Robot scripts defined in the AIC Standard
- `/examples` â€” Sample calls and annotated outputs
- `/assets` â€” Diagrams, logo, and visual materials
